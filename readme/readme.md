Writing all the rules of the game. Fun document. If you show up to a meeting under an hour you get one point. Over an hour you get two points. Scrum. If it goes two hours that's too long.

If you book an hour of time and it's only thirty minutes. Standard meeting is only thirty minutes. If it goes really but it's only between two people. Always when a private meeting. both people are consenting. But when it's seven people and it goes two hours then it's boring.

To Do: Add the Konstantine document.

Someone should get points for taking notes. If meeting goes long the scribe gets another point. In a perfect world Neel would have built a machine learning. Turn audio into text. Someon can summarize the meeting. but he would have gotten points. 

Some change
