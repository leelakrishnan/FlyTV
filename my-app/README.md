# FLYTV Documentation tips:

The most important thing you need to know is we chose to have improved documentation for and from Lead Developer Leela.

1. The first feature is web3 authorization. We used web3auth because makes it easier and more accessible for anyone to log into our application.
2. What happens if you log in with google and then try using your metamask to join? Try and find out!
3. don't forget to npm install if someone recently introduced new modules to the project :)
4. how many hours would it take to have something as comprehensive and amazing as https://docs.chain.link/docs/contributing-to-chainlink/ ??!
5. strangers, waiting.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Make sure your .env.local is set up (rename .env.local.example and paste in the correct info -- see secret channel in our discord or ask a dev -- if you've already run npm run dev, then restart that and it should work like a charm)

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
