# FlyTV

> Team Vote (Mates ? Machine)

## How to run on your local machine:

In my-app/ folder, make sure there is an ".env.local" file with usable values for:

1. WEB3AUTH_CLIENT_ID=
2. NEXT_PUBLIC_MORALIS_APP_ID=
3. NEXT_PUBLIC_MORALIS_SERVER_URL=
   > check the .env.local.example on what client id required for project to run

> make your own if you want, or ask the team for help.

If you want to read more drawings and documentation, check the readme/ folder. If you notice any obvious errors and want to contribute to this Open Source Software Project for Hackathon Hopefuls, read (GitHub Flow for Hackathons)[https://www.notion.so/Github-Flow-for-Hackathons-e0d394f3a1e64757b04b7e045ca0970a]. After that, you can delightfully use GitHub to contribute to this beginner-friendly and public community. You might just get some FLYTV badgerReward in the future.

An easy first bounty, fill in the blank (with GitHub!: Read-write-t\_\_\_\_-verify (Faber Web3 Webinar).

# Key components:

1. used web3auth for seamless login to app
2. Moralis backend for database and IPFS file storage
3. users can see all the currently created teams in Faber Hackathon
4. users can apply to join a team
5. team can review applications and onboard Mates

## Next steps:

1. Team Dashboard has github activity of all teammembers.
2. Project Dashboard helps keep Team on track (guardrails and NFT Surprise?)
3. Badgers Award Ceremony required to Complete Documentation
4. Whole Hackathon Showcase automatically generated from all teams/projects.
5. Email notifications?
6. Chat/video chat function (with funny filters)
7. Quadratic Voting like GitCoin

# DAO Concept

Once you are accepted onto the team, you will be allowed to mint an Welcomed NFT (based of which avatar you currently have chosen). Using that NFT you can claim a gift of 5 of the 10000 FLYTV tokens. 1 token can be spent to propose a "feature to do." Say we proposed a feature "Do a chat option using IPFS." When a Contributor makes a pull request that is merged into GitHub main with "Do a chat option using IPFS." The user wallet for the matching GitHub username is given 1 FLYTV. The proposer of the successful feature is returned their 1 token and given 1 token. The feature can also be NFTs that are burnable.

> The reason we do all this is because we want to incentivize good hackathon habits, which include proper open source ettiquite which requires 1-to-1 communication, making visible contributions to the project between meetings and keeping the Project board clean.

## Flight Path

Eventually, we hope to implement systems for minimizing, managing and tracking metadata about team meetings. We'd like to figure out a better way to distribute the prize money than just talking about what we should do or splitting equally.

# Bonus text:

> Every feature is a seperate story.
> If you want to create a proposal? (automatically vote yes)
> If you want to vote on a proposal?
> What happens if only one person is paying attention?
