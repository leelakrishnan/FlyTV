# FlyTVM

> Team Virtual (Mates ? Machine)

## How to run on your local machine:

In my-app/ folder, make sure there is an ".env.local" file with usable values for:

1. WEB3AUTH_CLIENT_ID=
2. NEXT_PUBLIC_MORALIS_APP_ID=
3. NEXT_PUBLIC_MORALIS_SERVER_URL=
   > check the .env.local.example on what client id required for project to run

> make your own if you want, or ask the team for help.

# Key components:

1. used web3auth for seamless login to app
2. Moralis backend for database and IPFS file storage
3. users can see all the currently created teams in Faber Hackathon
4. users can apply to join a team
5. team can review applications and onboard Mates

## Next steps:

1. Team Dashboard has github activity of all teammembers.
2. Project Dashboard helps keep Team on track (guardrails and NFT Surprise?)
3. Badgers Award Ceremony required to Complete Documentation
4. Whole Hackathon Showcase automatically generated from all teams/projects.
5. Email notifications?
